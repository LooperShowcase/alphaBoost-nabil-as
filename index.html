      Nvidia Corporation[note 1][note 2] (/ɛnˈvɪdiə/ en-VID-ee-ə) is an American
      multinational technology company incorporated in Delaware and based in
      Santa Clara, California.[2] It is a fabless company which designs graphics
      processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well
      as system on a chip units (SoCs) for the mobile computing and automotive
      market. Its primary GPU line, labeled "GeForce", is in direct competition
      with the GPUs of the "Radeon" brand by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
      Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld game
      consoles Shield Portable, Shield Tablet, and Shield Android TV and its
      cloud gaming service GeForce Now. Its professional line of GPUs are used
      in workstations for applications in such fields as architecture,
      engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive,
      scientific research, and manufacturing design.[3] In addition to GPU
      manufacturing, Nvidia provides an application programming interface (API)
      called CUDA that allows the creation of massively parallel programs which
      utilize GPUs.[4][5] They are deployed in supercomputing sites around the
      world.[6][7] More recently, it has moved into the mobile computing market,
      where it produces Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets as
      well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems.[8][9][10] In
      addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.[11][12]
